# Fiji_scripts
Scripts and macros for Fiji/ImageJ. 


The scripts can be run externally or installed. To run them, open the file by dragging it to the Fiji main window and press Run (Ctrl+R). To install a file by placing it in the plugins directory of your ImageJ application. File names can be changed but an underscore and the extension must remain.

The file Library.txt contains general purpose functions (e.g. get unique items from array) that can come in useful in the future. For the time being all scripts are self-contained, each one defines all the functions it requires.
